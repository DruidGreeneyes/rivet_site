# rivet_site
Low-grade proof-of-concept web-app to demonstrate rivet; built in python/django.

Currently, running on my raspberry pi, this can compare roughly 5000 words worth of text (in two documents) in about two seconds. Comparing Crime and Punishment(~200k words) to War and Peace(~600k words) took about a minute, and got a similarity score of 86.
